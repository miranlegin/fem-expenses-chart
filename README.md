## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Fetch API
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Some workaround technique for animating bar charts

### What I learned

I've worked before with Fetch API but after not using it for some time I always forget the syntax. This challenge sharpened my skills and i will gladly accent future challenges.

### Continued development

As this is one of the first challenges with Javascript i'm getting in the zone for tackle some more advanced examples as this is quite the basic one.

### Useful resources
